# CAR-PURCHASE-AMOUNT-USING-ANN
Developed an artificial neural network using TensorFlow and Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for [Car Purchase Amount Prediction].

Implemented a multi-layered neural network with hidden connections to identify complex patterns in the data.
Employed the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to introduce non-linearity into the network, improving its modeling capabilities.
Utilized libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building to streamline the development process.
